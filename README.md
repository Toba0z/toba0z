I‚Äôm passionate about tackling complex security challenges and aspire to lead Blue Team initiatives that proactively defend organizations from evolving cyber threats. With a reputation as a ‚Äújack of all trades,‚Äù I bring a well-rounded blend of technical skills and hands-on experience to strengthen cyber defenses and secure digital environments.

I hold a Diploma in Information Technology & Applied Systems, along with certifications including CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900). In my current role as a Cybersecurity Support Engineer, I conduct in-depth vulnerability assessments, prioritize high-risk findings, and implement automated remediation scripts using PowerShell achieving a 100% reduction in critical vulnerabilities and preventing brute-force attacks.

My technical toolkit includes expertise in Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), CVE/CWE management, CVSS scoring, OWASP Top 10, and scripting with PowerShell and Bash. I have experience configuring firewalls and network security groups (NSGs), and ensuring compliance with NIST and PCI-DSS frameworks. I regularly work with tools such as Tenable, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Microsoft Sentinel, using KQL to create actionable dashboards and conduct advanced threat hunting.

I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional environments bridging communication between technical teams and stakeholders while aligning security efforts with business goals. Known for my adaptability and precision, I bring proactive, results-driven solutions to every security challenge.

I‚Äôm always open to connecting with professionals and organizations focused on strengthening their cybersecurity posture. Let‚Äôs work together to defend against today‚Äôs threats and stay ahead of tomorrow‚Äôs.
